<p>Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, <span class="style1">“Follow Me.”</span></p>

<p><span class="style1">“There is need of coming close to the people by personal effort. If less time were given to sermonizing, and more time were spent in personal ministry, greater results would be seen. The poor are to be relieved, the sick cared for, the sorrowing and the bereaved comforted, the ignorant instructed, the inexperienced counseled. We are to weep with those that weep, and rejoice with those that rejoice.”</span>– <strong>Ministry of Healing, page 143.</strong></p>

<p>Newlife Seventh-day Adventist Church Chaplaincy Ministries is comprised of committed chaplains who understand chaplaincy brings a spiritual dimension to pastoral care. In a large sense, Newlife Church treats chaplaincy as a human service ministry that incorporates specific roles in meeting the wellbeing needs of a particular group or community. It does not compete with, but is complementary to and part of the overall pastoral care program of a learning community. Our chaplains are committed to Jesus-Christ and the global mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. These men and women desire to help people in the sites where they minister and share with them the soon coming of Jesus.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
      </li><p>Through the ministry of these chaplains, Newlife Church recognizes and responds to the needs of persons within their unique institutional/organizational settings, including penitentiaries, high schools and educational campuses, healthcare institutions and so on… An incarnational ministry of presence is offered to all persons in need. </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p><p>The Newlife SDA Church is committed to endorsing only qualified clergy in chaplaincy ministries.  Endorsement is granted only to individuals who qualify for appropriate ministerial credentials, and who nominated to serve or are serving as chaplains in one of the following chaplaincies:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>1. Schools  </p>
    <p>2. Corrections – Prison Ministry.</p>
    <p>3. Health Care – Hospitals Ministry</p>

    </p>

<p>In prisons, Newlife Seventh-day Adventist Church chaplains can be found living the words of Christ, “I was in prison, and you came unto me.” These men and women are key members of the correctional care team as they bring the grace of God to inmates who need Christ and rehabilitation so they can return to a productive role in society. Chaplains go where most others cannot, including death row, to do their tasks as ministers of the Gospel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Area Remand Prison</strong> – In this prison our chaplains provide Sabbath services and other forms of rehabilitative training tailored to reduce drug and substance abuse, counseling and provision of lacking basic needs such as toiletries, hygiene and health care and clothing.  In addition to the spiritual nourishment and evangelistic effort, the Ministry also helps the released remandees to integrate back into the society. By 2013, we had undertaken a large number of major initiatives in the Prison Ministry .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Upcoming Projects</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h2>HOSPITAL MINISTRY (Health Care Chaplaincy)</h2>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>
  <p>Elder : Isaac Lumumba</p>
  <p>Leader: Beatrice Owiyo</p>
  <p>Deputy: Fridah Kichari</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
     
<p> The mission Newlife Seventh-day Adventist Church Hospital Chaplaincy Ministry is to advance the integration of spiritual care in health care through care and prayer practice, in order to provide therapeutic exchange meant to improve patient experience and satisfaction and to help people faced with illness and grief find comfort and meaning--whoever they are, whatever they believe, wherever they are. We serve those who are ill, family and friend caregivers, and other health care professionals who deal every day with the stress of illness and loss.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p> Newlife Seventh-day Adventist Church healthcare chaplains deal with the most challenging situations, encountering the sick and the dying. They offer spiritual care-related services and professional chaplaincy services to the sick and the vulnerable who need them They visit patients in a variety of settings including hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities, hospices, and private homes.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p> Healthcare chaplains not only work with patients, their families and hospital staff; they also serve in communities. The spiritual care specialists on the Hospital Ministries team as doctors and nurses focus on caring for the body, and as the recognition grows that whole-person care encompasses spirit, mind, and body. Their challenge is not only to assist the very ill in wards but also to help people grow toward health and wholeness, seeking to be a continuation of the healing ministry of Christ. Then they bring them to Christ… to the Church of Christ. Newlife Church healthcare chaplains also work with administrators and church leaders facilitating the mission of their institutions.</p>

     <h2>CHAPLAINCY MINISTRY FOR SCHOOLS</h2>
    <p>  </p>
    <img src="images/mangu2.jpg">   
        <p>
        <p>Elder and Coordinator: Tom Onyambu</p>
        <p>Elder : Yudah Odongo</p>
<p>Elder : Reuben Orwaru - Lower Division</p>
<p>Elder : Cosmas Makori</p>
      <p>Coordinator: Jeremiah Omari</p>
        <p>Deputy: Adeline Masinde</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
                      
<p> Newlife Seventh-day Adventist Church chaplains who serve in schools around Nairobi County comprise the largest group of professional chaplains. In the book, <span class="style3">Child Guidance</span>, Ellen White wrote, <span class="style1">"We need men well trained, well educated, to work in the interests of the churches...religious training shall not be neglected."</span> Adventist Chaplaincy Ministries believes that a "well educated" chaplain corps provides the best in ministry and spiritual care to those within our sphere of influence.</p>
     
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p><p> Newlife Seventh-day Adventist Church Schools Chaplaincy Ministries exists to develop the faith of High school students who cannot come to church during schooling months, leading them into union with the church. The Ministry is responsible for nurturing the student of children in high school spiritually, socially and at spiritual level. We teach our Adventist students about God's love for them and we prepare them for the Great Commission. They are also taught and encouraged to express their love for God and love for their teachers and appreciate God's creation work and the important SDA core principles of the Sabbath rest and the Three Angels Message. We ground them in the Bible through Bible Study.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p> We import the practice of prayer. We prepare them for baptism and we baptize them. We take Holy Communion to them. Every Sabbath, our chaplains conduct Sabbath service that includes Sabbath School classes and divine service. We involve them and prepare them for leadership by letting them conduct themselves – we identify leaders among them who we work through. We give them strong Christian foundations who will be committed workers for Christ in their later pre-school lives. This helps them to develop friendship with Jesus, knowledge of the bible and connect with the society.</p>  
     
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p>  As school chaplain progress through each level of working with students, they are exposed to new and emerging challenges. Mostly the schools are inter- denominational and multi-cultural and the Adventist students mix with non-Adventist ones. The students are placed in a broad sphere of influence.</p> 
<p> Our School Chaplains in all settings have the necessary skills and training to work with a designated population in counseling and critical stress management, leadership, religious education, and active community outreach. </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p> As a specialized ministry, Schools Chaplaincy does not require theological education, not even specific insights from the behavioral sciences, as well. Our Chaplains are trained and thoroughly orientated to make them suitable for their roles. They are mostly equipped with the love of Christ and with prayer and commitment, they do a fantastic job nurturing our Adventist children in schools.  Their mission is to provide spiritual nourishment and religious resources to support the spiritual well-being of Seventh-day Adventist students.</p>
