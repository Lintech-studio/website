<h2>The Practices That Make a Great Deacon.</h2>

<p>I want to be a better deacon in 2017. Recently I was faced with a thought: What makes a great deacon?</p>
<p>We as deacons are striving this year to become more connected with our congregation though direct contact, being available and being visible.  This is something that we have identified as being very important in plugging into our role as leaders in all facets of stewardship.</p>
<p>Today, for the biblical church, these roles are essentially the same. Elders and pastors are to “preach the word…reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching” (2 Timothy 4:2), and deacons are to be appointed to take care of everything else. In a modern church, this might include taking on administrative or organizational tasks, ushering, being responsible for building maintenance, or volunteering to be the church treasurer. It depends on the need and the gifts of the available men.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of a deacon are not clearly listed or outlined; they are assumed to be everything that does not include the duties of an elder or pastor, which is to preach, teach, and exhort. But qualifications for a deacon’s character are clearly outlined in Scripture. They are to be blameless, the husband of one wife, a good household manager, respectable, honest, not addicted to alcohol and not greedy (1 Timothy 3:8-12). According to the Word, the office of deacon is an honor and a blessing. “For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 3:13).</p>
<p>But the question remains: What PRACTICES make a great deacon?</p>

<blockquote> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> <q>A deacon should be qualified to do whatever needs to be done. He may need to unplug a commode or he may be needed to teach the lesson on Sabbath School class. His attitude should be, here am I Lord, send me. It seems to me that Isaiah may have been the equivalent of a deacon in Isaiah 6. The good deacon will not be a wimp but he must have the self assurance of a living Lord.</q> </blockquote>

<p>The following are some of the qualities I have held close to my chest:</p>
<p>1.  A good deacon must be a prayer worrior. He must pray for the Church, the pastors, the elders... everyone. He/she cultivates a habit of praying for the congregation, for the community, for the world.  Praying should be a paramount habit in the daily life of a deacon. </p>

<p>2.  A great deacon's work extends beyond the church precints.  This is another spiritual discipline that I learnt that underlies great deacons.  Greeting people, observing what’s happening, watching for things to praise and appreciate.  Praying and walking and watching for the gifts that God has put into the community.  Just being around is so important – listening, caring, encouraging. </p>
<p>3.  Serving and giving. A great deacon is both a steward and a chaplain. He must serve God and man anytime anywhere. Dr. Mogere recently told me that a deacon, in general,  function as servants, ministering to the body in practical ways. He reckons that deacons can even serve in a Presidential function. <em>"With the deacon's badge on, you will be honoured and allowed to serve,"</em> he said. That got me thinking about a rule I learnt as a boy scout: <em>be prepared.</em></p>
<p>4.  Deacons must be men, real men, mighty men of faith. They must live a life of faith and exercise that faith, bombarding their sub-conscious mind with the pure, powerful and positive thoughts from the Word of God.</p>
<p>5.  A deacon is a church leader of rank, coming shortly after the elder. He must be conscious of his position all times and pray for the Holy Spirit to lead him to walk in the footsteps of Christ. Our own effort plays a part in being a true Christian, it is very Biblical (2 Peter 1:5-7; Hebrews 6:11; 2 Peter 1:10) and logical. So a deacon, being a church leader, must carry himself at all times with attributes of good virtue and he must be a good example for Christ. His dress code, his mannerisms, his talks and his thoughts must reflect the character of God. He must always pray so that The Holy Spirit will always be with him and guide him in all ways.</p>


<p> What are the duties of a good deacon? Simple! Do what the Pastor and or the other deacons tell him to do. Learn how to be a servant in the Church. Help the widows, orphans & needy. Be prepared for God's hand (not mens hands) to put you into the work of the ministry. Why, you could wind up in Africa as a missionary. If you are not willing to do that then resign from God and the deacon bored. A deacon is just a servant.. don't forget.</p>
<div class="auther-box">
<div class="text-box"> <strong class="title"></strong>
<p>He must be a faithful supporter of the Church, both in finance and faithfulness. His only reason for missing a Church service must be excusable before God. He must involve himself in the physical maintanance and projects of the Church. Brother Milton Okuthe says, <em>"He must feel the responsibility to encourage lagging Church members to faithfulness. He will be directly and personally involved in reaching prospects for the Lord. He will exercise any talents that God has given in the ministry of the services</em>." He will be ready and willing to step in and fill any task that he is able to accomplish. He must never be a part of the sowing of discord within the Church. Rather, if he is aware of such conflicts, do what he can to root out the discord and settle it properly. It would be wise to be in communication with the Pastor in resolving any such matters.

The deacon should rise above the norm in personal Bible study. Bible study is the key to maturity and ability in the Lord's house. The many areas of instruction and learning within a Church usually demand that every officer be ready and able to step into the teaching ministry.</p>
