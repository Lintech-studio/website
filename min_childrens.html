<p><span class="style1">“There is need of coming close to the people by personal effort. If less time were given to sermonizing, and more time were spent in personal ministry, greater results would be seen. The poor are to be relieved, the sick cared for, the sorrowing and the bereaved comforted, the ignorant instructed, the inexperienced counseled. We are to weep with those that weep, and rejoice with those that rejoice.”</span>– <strong>An Appeal to the Youth p. 40.</strong></p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p><p>The Children Ministries of Newlife Seventh-day Adventist Church comprises of the following sub-units:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>1. Beginners Class (0 - 3)</p>
    <p>2. Kindergarten A (3 - 4)</p>
    <p>3. Kindergarten B (4 - 6)</p>
    <p>4.  Primary B (6 - 7)</p>
        <p>5. Primary A (8 - 9)</p>

    <p>6. Powerpoint (10 - 12)</p>
        <p>7. Realtime (13 - 15)</p>

    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
   
<p>Newlife Seventh-day Adventist Church Children Ministries Department exists to develop the faith of children from birth through age fourteen, leading them into union with the church. The department is responsible for nurturing the development of children from age 0 to 16 years spiritually, socially and at family level. We teach children about God's love for them and for all of us. They are also taught and encouraged to express their love for God and love for neighbors and appreciate God's creation work. This helps them to develop friendship with Jesus, knowledge of the bible and connect with the society. The activities carried out by the department are designed to ensure that the children are involved in spiritually uplifting activities that mold them to become strong Christians and upright members of the society.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p><p>The Children’s Department is to win, hold and train for Jesus Christ, youth, boys and girls, for the service of God. Goal-oriented spiritual education is meant to:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>1. Present a personal Christ</p>
    <p>2.	Stimulate interest in Scripture</p>
    <p>3.	Teach moral responsibility</p>
    <p>4.	Involve youth in service</p>
    <p>5.	Involve youth in mission outreach</p>
     <p>6.	Encourage high self-regard</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>

<p>To achieve these goals, we have put in place plans that take the children through various programs throughout the year. Some of the programs we have in Newlife SDA Church includes Sabbath School classes, Children Church services, Children Sabbath services, Children camp meeting and Children club activities like pro-active choir, pathfinder, adventurer etc. We also organize social events and nature tours.</p>
  
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
     
<p> Each Sabbath morning, Sabbath schools for each age group welcome children to an hour of active learning geared to their stage of faith development. These classes provide faith-shaping experiences for newborns through adolescents.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p>Amazingly, more than 600 children enthusiastically participate in our worship each Sabbath. The Children’s Ministries Department cooperates with the Sabbath School department and other departments to provide religious education to the children.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p> Ellen G. White underscores the importance of children’s ministry when she says: <span class="style1">“Too much importance cannot be placed on the early training of children. The lessons that the child learns during the first seven years of life have more to do with forming his character than all it learns in the future years.”</span> – <strong>Child Guidance, p. 193.</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>    
 
<p><span class="style1">“When Jesus told the disciples not to forbid the children to come to Him, He was speaking to His followers in all ages- to officers of the church, to ministers, helpers and all Christians. Jesus is drawing the children, and He bids us, Suffer them to come; as if He would say, They will come if you do not hinder them.”</span> – <strong>The Desire of Ages</strong>, p.517.</span> </p>

 <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Proactive Kids Choir a strong Pillar</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
                      
<p> The Proactive Kids Choir is a church based children choir of Newlife Seventh-day Adventist Church. It is one of the oldest and largest children choir in the East and Central Africa region. Guided by the mission to spread God’s word through music, the choir is happy to be enjoying over 16 years of service and glory to God through song since the inception in the late 90’s.</p>
     
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p><p> It will be remembered that the Proactive Kids choir participated in the General Conference Session that was held in the year 2000 in Toronto, Canada under the inspiration and guidance of <strong>Dr. Saustine Mfune</strong> assisted by the supportive parents and Newlife SDA Church.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p>In 2001 during the Satelite Evangelism efforts in Mwanza, Tanzania, the choir was not left behind as they had over 50 children participating. The choir would later participate in other similar efforts being <span class="style1">Safari Africa </span>in 2008 <span class="style1">Jesus is Coming series of Hope 2010</span> and <span class="style1">Madhabau Ya Dhahabu 2016</span> all held in Nairobi Kenya.</p>  
     
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p>Despite its operation like a separate department, the choir has worked closely and always cooperatively, with the lower division department which serves as the custodian, parent and authority of the choir. While complementing the efforts of the larger children department of Newlife SDA Church, the choir in 2010 helped in an outreach mission to Bunga SDA Church in Uganda and participated in the children Residential Camp Meeting that was held in Kigali Central Church, Rwanda.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </p>
<p> Notably, the choir has been part of the successful children residential Camp Meetings that have been held for four years now. In 2011, Africa Nazarene University, Kenya; In 2012 Kigali Central Church, Rwanda; In 2013 Word of Life Camp, Kenya; In 2014 St Georges Girls Secondary School, Kenya; In 2015 at Lenana School.
The Choir in collaboration with the Children Ministry Department of Newlife has also been able to carry out mission activities in Chuka, Meru in December 2015 where more than 40 Children joined the Seventh-Day Adventist church. We welcome all children to join us as we wait for the Lord's soon return.</p>
