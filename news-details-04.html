<h3 class="fa-2x"><strong>Introducing The New Newsletter: The Present Truth</strong></h3>

<p>As I was developing this Website and  a communications strategy for our church last year, I found myself considering the role of our monthly, printed Newsletter. It has actually been around in my mind for two years, but since we are re-launching our communications department with a new look in an ambitious and Holy-Spirit-led initiative to digitize our church, we have to come up with some very powerful communication tools. It is time Newlife SDA Church Nairobi had a newsletter for evangelistic purposes in these End Times. And it is the mandate of the Communications Department to come up with creative and modern tools for communicating the Three Angels Message and a newsletter is at the top of the list.</p>

<p>Our Newsletter has been finalized and is complete with a new name: The Present Truth. Initially I wanted a Kiswahili name and thought of a name like <em>Kutetereka</em> (The Shaking). The name <em>The Present Truth</em> is derived from one of Ellen G. White’s End Time prophecies.  </p>

</div>
<blockquote> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> <q> Discernment is a gift that accompanies the Holy Spirit who is our umpire that keeps us awake to distinguish truth from error. The Bible tells us to grow in discernment, so that we can mature and help others who are easily deceived. Being grounded in the core doctrines of the faith and building on them makes one immune to the many deceptions that surround us today, this is what this video series is about.</q> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i> </blockquote>
<div class="right">
<p>“<em>The Present Truth</em> will be a full Bible truth publication with emphasis on End Time information.</p>

<p><em>"But God will not save us if we make no effort to do the work he has committed to our charge. We must be found faithfully at our posts, watching as valiant soldiers, lest Satan shall gain an advantage which it is our duty to prevent. We should diligently study the Word of God, and pray in faith that God will restrain the powers of darkness; for as yet the message has gone to comparatively few, and the world is to be lightened with its glory. The present truth regarding the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus has not yet been sounded as it must be. There are many almost within the shadow of our own doors for whose salvation no personal effort has been made.</em>" (E.White, Review and Herald, March 9, 1911).</p>

<p>God has given us His true Word in the Bible. And it is in all of our power to seek and find the truth for ourselves. But if we rely on someone elses teaching, rather than finding out the truth ourselves, and end up being deceived and lost, then we only have ourselves to blame and we will deserve the judgment.</p>

<p>Friends, <em>The Present Truth</em> is about what it says: the present truth. We need to take the Word of the Lord and His commands seriously. We cannot play about anymore, thinking that God will forgive us for 'assuming' that we can take His commands lightly. And we cannot depend upon others to teach us the truth. We need to find out the truth ourselves, because we stand alone in the judgment. We will be unable to put the blame on anyone else. God has given us His truth and commands in the Bible. It is down to us to live according to that truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10 Reasons why our Church NEEDS This Newsletter at this Time.</h2>

<p>We are told in the last days that false prophets will increase, that deception will be pervasive in the world and IN THE CHURCH. What are the New Spirit movements and methods that are consistently springing up and entering the church? Discernment is the need of the hour for our survival and keeping the faith of Biblical Christianity. </p>

<p>Discernment is a gift that accompanies the Holy Spirit who is our umpire that keeps us awake to distinguish truth from error. The Bible tells us to grow in discernment, so that we can mature and help others who are easily deceived. Being grounded in the core doctrines of the faith and building on them makes one immune to the many deceptions that surround us today, this is what this video series is about.</p>

<p>We could name a number of reasons for launching this newsletter. Allow me to share ten of our convictions.</p>


<p>1.  A newsletter  is (and has always been) a powerful tool for ministry in the Advent Movement. Our Church was called by God and the foundational tool used has always been the written word. The first tool used, The Review and Herald, was in form of a printed newsletter.</p>
<p>2.  Newsletters Inform All Church Members, Not Just That Week’s Attendees —Because of the absentism or decline in the frequency of attendance, many church members are unaware of events or happenings at their church. Email newsletters allow you communicate to everyone at once.</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Newsletters Allow for Comprehensive Information</strong> — If you were to get a separate email for each activity or ministry in the church, it would be way too much. One simple newsletter that covers all the ministries of the church is much easier to digest for church members than individual messages. Some age-level ministries may need their own newsletters, but not every ministry a church has needs a separate newsletter.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>Digital Newsletters Are Cheaper and More Effective Than Print</strong> — High production costs are one reason print newsletters died. Minimal production costs are one of the main benefits of digital newsletters. Many providers offer free email newsletter services for small lists. For bigger lists, even a paid service would cost just pennies on the dollar compared to a printed newsletter.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Email Allows Immediate Action</strong> — This might be the most important reason to have an email newsletter for our church. With one click, members or guests can take action. Whether that’s signing up for a class or volunteering, registering for an event, or giving to a special offering, email offers the recipient the opportunity to act immediately without having to remember to do so later—like a bulletin or announcement in the service.</p>
<p>6.  <strong>Increased Awareness of Online Giving Increases Stewardship</strong> — Our church needs funds for needed resources. We pray that this free newsletter will help. We also will point to our free or affordable resources.  Our church has online giving on our Website, reminding your members about that option in our monthly newsletter is a must. For those who may be traveling, a small button with the option for giving electronically may be the difference in giving or not giving their tithes and offerings.</p>
<p>7.  <strong>Included Devotionals Aid in Personal Discipleship</strong> — Finally, our newsletters will be be used as a devotional aid. Members will easily include devotionals, prayer requests, or daily Bible readings for use throughout the month.</p>
<p>8. The newsletter will quicken up publicity for the new Website. We pray the newsletter will establish an outreach even to non-Adventists and the messages featured will draw men and women to the Remnant Church. </p>
<p>9.  9.	Pastors deal with enormous pressures and constant criticisms. We want them to know we have their backs. This Newsletter will establish another avenue for ministry and wider message announcements.</p>
<p>10. If through this Newsletter we can help our members, the pastors, our elders and our various ministries within the church, we will also help churches, the bride of Christ.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Present Truth</em> will be published twelve times each year.  It will be  available initially be available electronic formats.  If you would like to receive this incredibly informative publication consider becoming a member of SDA.</p>

<p>Some of the articles in our monthly publications will also be found online.  We will have a menu at the far right and to see articles available from the current month’s issue click on "Current Issue" in the menu on the right.  Previous months newsletters will be viewed in the "Article Archive" section which will contain articles beginning March 2017.  </p>

<p>Due to unforeseen circumstances and financial constraints, the new Newsletter will only available per email.  We are still sorting out the technicalities to post the Newsletter as a template on the website and until then the newsletter will be available by email. </p>

<p>It is my prayer and dream that this newsletter will be anticipated each week by tens of thousands of pastors and staff. We at Newlife are determined to make this resource a first class newsletter at no cost to our readers. We are determined to provide outstanding content and point readers to great resources.</p>
